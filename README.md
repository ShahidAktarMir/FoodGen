Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are to deliver a high-quality food ordering application that exhibits excellence in terms of reliability, scalability, and performance. The application aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive interface, efficient navigation, real-time information, and an overall delightful user experience while ordering food from various restaurants.
II. Technology Stack
React:
Leveraging the power of React, a widely adopted JavaScript library, to build a highly modular and reusable codebase. React promotes efficient component-based development, enhancing code maintainability, and enabling seamless integration of new features.

Redux:
Implementing Redux, a robust state management library, to ensure a centralized and predictable state management approach. Redux facilitates efficient data flow, simplifies complex state updates, and promotes code stability and maintainability.

React Router:
Integrating React Router to enable smooth and seamless navigation within the application. React Router ensures consistent routing, dynamic rendering of components, and optimized user experience across different sections of the application.

Parcel Bundler:
Utilizing Parcel Bundler, a modern and efficient bundling tool, to streamline the application's build process. Parcel Bundler optimizes asset bundling and enables faster load times, resulting in enhanced performance and user satisfaction.

Tailwind CSS:
Employing Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Tailwind CSS provides a comprehensive set of utility classes, facilitating rapid development, consistent styling, and code maintainability.

Swiggy Public API:
Integrating the Swiggy Public API, a well-established and reliable food delivery platform, to leverage its extensive restaurant listings, menus, and real-time order tracking capabilities. This integration ensures accurate and up-to-date information, delivering a seamless ordering experience to users.

III. Software Quality Practices

Modular Code Architecture:
Following a modular code architecture that promotes code reusability, encapsulation, and maintainability. Modular components enhance code organization, facilitate unit testing, and simplify the addition of new features or changes in the future.

Unit Testing:
Implementing comprehensive unit tests using industry-standard frameworks such as Jest and Enzyme. Unit tests validate the functionality of individual components, ensuring code correctness, and minimizing the risk of regressions.

End-to-End Testing:
Conducting rigorous end-to-end testing using Cypress to validate user flows, test system integration, and ensure smooth interactions between different application modules. End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios, uncover potential issues, and contribute to a stable and reliable application.

Version Control and Collaboration:
Utilizing Git as a version control system to manage code changes, enable collaborative development, and ensure seamless integration of new features. Version control enables effective code review, traceability, and facilitates teamwork among developers.
